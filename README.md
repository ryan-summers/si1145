This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the Silicon Labs Si1145 light sensor,
based on the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.

## The Device

The Si1145/46/47 is a low-power, reflectance-based, infrared proximity, ultraviolet (UV) index, and
ambient light sensor with I2C digital interface and programmable event interrupt output.
